     <h3>Three Good websites:</h3>
         <li><a href="https://www.skillshare.com">
skillshare.com</a>
             <p>I really like the use of large images and the limited amount of
             text that accompanies each one. Right off the bat the large 
             darkened  image of someone drawing with white text and a green 
             sign-up button on top catches your attention and already gives 
             you some sort of idea as to what the website is about. As you 
             scroll down the home page the same green color of the button from 
             before remains as an accent color which creates a sense of unity 
             and is visually appealing against the darker images and background
             color, but also looks good with the white ones. The fonts they use 
             are beautiful, they look professional, clean, and are bold enough 
             where they need to be and they all look really nice together.

             <p>With this website I like the limited use of color as well, it's
             mostly black and white with red accents. I think it's nice how when
             the mouse hovers over a drop down menu in the top bar that it
             becomes red and that the categories in each one is in red and is a 
             bigger size than the subcategories which are in grey until you 
             hover over them and then they turn red. This website also has a set
             of images that change between each other in a loop with a small box
             of text over them. I like how the categories of art supplies have 
             images and how nice and organized all of the images for the 
             products are. This website also has a set of fonts that are clean 
             and sharp and add a level of professionalism. I really appreciate 
             that this website gives you three different options to display the 
             products: list view, detail view, and grid view.

        <li><a href="https://www.hollar.com">
hollar.com</a>
             <p>Hollar also sticks to a pretty simple limited color palette 
             consisting of mostly white, black, and a bit of bright orange. The 
             fact that the prices of products are in orange makes them stand out
             which is good since theyâ€™re trying to get you to buy stuff. On here
             the categories and dropdown menu also change color when hovered 
             over which is nice. The name of the website and the shopping cart 
             as well as the clearance and $1 shop are in the same orange color 
             which looks nice and once again draws your attention to them. I 
             really like the font they used for the name of the website and the 
             other fonts are clean and simple, the font used for item 
             descriptions are nice and thin.

        <h3>Three Bad websites:</h3>
         <li><a href="https://www.yahoo.com">
yahoo.com</a>
             <p>This website is very cluttered looking and has a ton of ads.
             There's so much to look at that you don't really know where they 
             want you to look exactly, and as you continue to go down the page 
             you find even more clutter with even more ads, some of which are 
             those annoying video ads. Using it as a search engine it doesn't 
             seem so bad or annoying and is actually useable, but when it comes
             to news, regardless of the specific kind, you'll find that the 
             article is surrouned by ads and other extra junk which is 
             unpleasant to look at and would discourage me from reading it.

        <li><a href="https://www.wetcanvas.com">
wetcanvas.com</a>
             <p>I think that most of the text, especially the text for the 
             categories, are way too small. It's really simple and looks pretty
             basic and plain. I don't really like the look of the website or 
             the way that it's set up where there's a bunch of different forums
             within each of the categories. It means that to look at many 
             different artworks I'd have to browse through several forums. It's 
             kind of inconvenient.
            </p>

        <li><a href="https://www.starvinartist.com">
starvinartist.com</a>
             <p>The design has way too much white space and the font and colors
             for the texts make it look very childish. It does not look 
             professional. They also sell a very small amount of art supplies 
             and all these things considered, I'm not sure that I'd trust this 
             site enough to actually buy anything from it.
