         <p>My name's Stephannie, but some of my friends call me Steph for
         short, which I'm totally cool with. I'm a self taught artist, I love
         drawing. I can draw both digitally and traditionally. I use various
         mediums and I really enjoy drawing people in a cartoony style.
         I've done some pixel art too, here's one I did for fun and made into
         a simple animation:
         <br>
         <img src= "yum.gif" alt= "pixel girl and donut" width= "200" height= "200" /></p>
